								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="Smilewithroll.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am a McGill Graduate, looking to synthesize curriculum theory with cognitive science. Specifically, I am trying to argue that it is a moral necessity to create intellectually rigorous curriculums for the next generation of students to develop into fully autonomous adults. To do so, we must forge an intimate link between the research findings of Cognitive Science and Curriculum development. I have written a manuscript pertaining to how I would approach this situation, and the theory behind my idea; it can be found in the “Manuscript” section of my website. 
								<p>Aside from research, my passions lay in exercise, reading and language learning. I lift weights no less than six-times a week, and intend to be trilingual within a year or two, by re-gaining my childhood language of Slovak. Afterwards, I will be acquiring Czech, followed by either German or Spanish. To me, languages are under-valued wonders of the world, and I intend to master as many as I possibly can to enrich my mind.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Research Experience</h3>
								<p>Throughout my undergraduate degree, I have volunteered in various labs and have written three thesis papers across a broad range of topics in psychological research. All three of my papers received the grade of A, with my first thesis being published in the McGill Journal of Human Behaviour in 2021!<p></p> 
									<p>(I created a dedicated "Writing Sample" Section where I go into more detail about my research theses, as well as selected essays from my undergraduate degree. You can read all my papers in this section should you desire to do so!)</p>
								</p>I can say with confidence that I thoroughly enjoyed my time in all the labs I worked in. Within two years, I was able to work in the Human Motivation Lab, McGill University Health Centre, Communication and Consciousness Lab and the MOGILab! Each of these labs granted me invaluable opportunities to satisfy my curiosity for intellectual pursuits in research, as well as expand my expertise within the domains of human behaviour, cognitive science, and neuroscience. Furthermore, each principal investigator carried a unique perspective on how to conduct and interpret research that I carry with me to this day and ultimately aim to implement in the near future as I advance my career. As cliché as it may sound, without them I would not be where I am today, pursuing a career in research.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Career Aspirations</h3>
							</p>Even though it may seem divergent to steer my research aspirations into education when evaluating my background, it was a result of working with such exemplary researchers that I realized my attention would be needed elsewhere. Their work is stellar and leaves me confident that research in the psychological sciences are in good hands, and I can explore my interests in another domain, without feeling like I am leaving something behind. Today, I see that there is an ever-expanding gap between academics and lay-folk -- and this has become exacerbated with the rise of technology -- and knowing that science is in good hands, I would like to extend my energy in a domain where less attention is being paid to, and that is uniting applied psychology and education into a single unit of study.</p>
						</p>As of right now, I am currently writing a thesis/scientific paper in my free time as to how I would like to synthesize the two fields, and I will upload it to my Writing Samples section once it is completed.</p>

									<p>In this section I will go through the three undergraduate theses I wrote, as well as include two selected essays of mine. If you have any questions about the samples that I have provided, please do not hesitate in reaching out about any questions you may have, I would be delighted to answer them!</p>
									<h3 class="major">Research Papers</h3>	
									<p>For my first thesis, I investigated the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students from a Self-Determination Theory perspective. I was working closely with <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/richard-koestner">Dr. Richard Koestner</a>, we used a 6-wave longitudinal design (n = 379) to examine how needs satisfaction and depressive symptoms manifested throughout the academic year. Our results demonstrated that the initial Covid Lockdowns placed incredible amounts of stress on students, which stymied their psychological needs from being satisfied by a significant margin. Consequently, this also exacerbated any depressive symptoms that were present within our sample, and we found that there was a strong association between the degree that their psychological needs were thwarted and their rise in depressive symptoms. Ultimately, this thesis would be my first publication and the link to it is found <a href="Publication 1.pdf">here</a>.</p>
											<p>Not long after I wrote my first scientific paper, I joined <a href="https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/harnad">Dr. Stevan Harnad</a>’s lab and wrote a cognitive science <a href="Robert_Contofalsky_PSYC494_Final_Version.pdf">paper</a> about a pilot project to examine how/if humans can learn auditory categories through supervised learning. Excitingly enough, our study was a success and we demonstrated that our categories are learnable from our sample of 35 participants.</p>
									<p>In my senior year, I worked on a very technical neurochemical project with <a href="https://aleksandrinaskv.github.io/">Dr. Aleksandrina Skvortsova</a> while under the supervision of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/jeffrey-mogil">Dr. Jeffrey Mogil.</a> Throughout the academic year, we investigated the nocebo hyperalgesia effect and its underlying neurochemistry. The results of the study will remain confidential until publication. We are aiming to be published in the “Canadian Journal of Pain” in Q2 of 2023.</p> 
									<h3 class="major">Selected Essays</h3>
									<p>When it comes to my personal writing samples that I would like to share I chose two very specific pieces of writing: my final undergraduate paper, and a persoanl manuscript written in my free time.</p> 
									<p>For my last undergrad <a href="Contofalsky_R_HIST509_FINAL.pdf">paper</a>, it is of a very different tone compared to my research-heavy background as it was written for my history minor. To keep things brief (as this essay is very complicated), this was my final essay for the seminar class <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2022-2023/courses/hist-509">"European Intellectual History”</a>, where we investigated how medieval translators carried and maintained significant medieval history, culture, politics, and science. For my topic, I chose to write about the Slavic disciples, Cyril and Methodius, and the linguistic, theological and political journey they embarked on when creating a writing system for the Slavs.</p>
									<p>The manuscript that I am currently writing about on my free time is my personal thesis/theory as to how cognitive science can, and should be synthesized with education/pedagogy. In this paper, I try to make the argument that the intellectual demands that civilization place on human beings necessitates an educational system that can keep up with those demands. In other words, the future should transform the K-12 curriculum from a “fit-to-work” model to a “fit-for-autonomy” model, and not only is this necessary, but that is possible as a result of how our brains categorize information.</p>
