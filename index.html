								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="Smilewithroll.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am a McGill Graduate, looking to synthesize curriculum theory with cognitive science. Specifically, I am trying to argue that it is a moral necessity to create intellectually rigorous curriculums for the next generation of students to develop into fully autonomous adults. To do so, we must forge an intimate link between Cognitive Science and Curriculum development. I am currently writing a manuscript/book pertaining to how I would approach this situation, and the theory behind my idea. Once completed, it will be in the “Manuscript” section of my website. 
								<p>Aside from research, my passions lay in exercise, reading, and language learning. I lift weights no less than six-times a week, and intend to be trilingual within a year or two, by re-gaining my childhood language of Slovak. Afterwards, I will be acquiring Czech, followed by either German or Spanish. To me, languages are under-valued wonders of the world, and I intend to master as many as I possibly can to enrich my mind.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Getting in touch</h3>
								<p></p>I am currently living in Montreal and the best way to reach me is via email at: <a href="mailto:robert.contofalsky@mail.mcgill.ca">robert.contofalsky@mail.mcgill.ca</a></p>

								<h2 class="major">Mission Statement</h2>
								<p>The R-Academy podcast provides a platform for the democratization of information about highly localized and niche topics. Its host, Robert Contofalsky, firmly believes in the importance of “Open-Acces” like platforms where conversations about psychology, history, and science do not have barriers or paywalls behind them. The future of our society depends on the information that we are given at the time, and he believes that this podcast would be a contribution to this overall goal.</p>
								<p>The topics discussed on this podcast will start where Robert has the most outreach: academia. He has maintained good relations with many professors and, thus, will begin by conversing with professors in Psychology and history, eventually expanding outwards. However, the “limited” faculty list is not a defect of the podcast, these are world-class scholars that he will be talking to, and the conversations will be nothing short of engaging and insight. Here is a list of topics that will be covered:</p>
								<ul>	
									<li>The nature of consciousness, language, and communication</li>
  									<li>The Psychology of personality, pain, neuroscience, and Culture</li>
  									<li>The heritability of behaviour and intelligence, and its societal implications</li>
 									<li>Medieval history, translational history; the nature of writing</li>
 									 <li>The Cold War and American history</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This podcast will concentrate on academic affairs for the time being, with the hope of expanding outwards into more niche domains of scholarly topics. The potential for topics on this podcast will be infinite as professors are never done talking about their work, and that is the beauty of this podcast, is that it will allow the listeners to understand the work of top-shelf experts in a digestible format, and give them the opportunity to continue their curiosities in the topics that are discussed on this podcast.</p>
								<p>In sum, the purpose of this podcast is for the host to act like a tourist in the minds and workspace of his guests; it is a zone that is free of judgment, and its primary focus is inquiry.</p>
								<p>If you would like to appear on R-Academy, please fill out the form below with your name, email, and a brief message about who you are, and your reason for appearing on the show. Please note that Robert will personally select who he would like to appear on his show, and is not going to grant all applicants time on his show if he feels that they would not be in line with his podcast's vision.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Research Experience</h3>
								<p>Throughout my undergraduate degree, I have volunteered in various labs and have written three thesis papers across a broad range of topics in psychological research. All three of my papers received the grade of A, with my first thesis being published in the McGill Journal of Human Behaviour in 2021!<p></p> 
									<p>(I created a dedicated "Writing Sample" Section where I go into more detail about my research theses, as well as selected essays from my undergraduate degree. You can read all my papers in this section should you desire to do so!)</p>
								</p>I can say with confidence that I thoroughly enjoyed my time in all the labs I worked in. Within two years, I worked in the <a href="https://www.mcgillhumanmotivation.com/">McGill Human Motivation Lab</a>, <a href="https://rimuhc.ca/-/marc-martel">McGill University Health Centre</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Laboratoire-de-Cognition-et-Communication-Stevan-Harnad">Communication and Consciousness Lab</a> and the <a href="https://mogilab.ca/">MOGILab</a>. Each of these labs granted me invaluable opportunities to satisfy my curiosity for intellectual pursuits in research, as well as expand my expertise within the domains of human behaviour, cognitive science, and neuroscience. Furthermore, each principal investigator carried a unique perspective on how to conduct and interpret research that I carry with me to this day and ultimately aim to implement in the near future as I advance my career. As cliché as it may sound, without them I would not be where I am today, pursuing a career in research.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Ultimate Career Aspirations</h3>
							</p>Even though it may seem divergent to steer my research aspirations into education when evaluating my background, it was a result of working with such exemplary researchers that I realized my attention would be needed elsewhere. Their work is stellar and leaves me confident that research in the psychological sciences are in good hands, and I can explore my interests in another domain, without feeling like I am leaving something behind. Today, I see that there is an ever-expanding gap between academics and lay-folk –– which has been exacerbated by the rise of technology –– and knowing that scientific research is in good hands, I would like to extend my energy in a domain where a there is a dearth of attention, and that is uniting applied psychology and education into a single unit of study.</p>
						</p>As of right now, I am currently writing a book in my free time as to how I would like to synthesize the two fields, and I will upload it to my Writing Samples section once it is completed.</p>

									<p>In this section I will go through the three undergraduate theses I wrote, as well as include two selected essays of mine. If you have any questions about the samples that I have provided, please do not hesitate in reaching out about any questions you may have, I would be delighted to answer them!</p>
									<h3 class="major">Research Papers</h3>	
									<p>For my first thesis, I investigated the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students from a Self-Determination Theory perspective, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/richard-koestner">Dr. Richard Koestner</a>. For our study, we used a 6-wave longitudinal design (n = 379) to examine how needs satisfaction and depressive symptoms manifested throughout the academic year. Our results demonstrated that the initial Covid Lockdowns placed incredible amounts of stress on students, which stymied their psychological needs from being satisfied by a significant margin. Consequently, this also exacerbated any depressive symptoms that were present within our sample, and we found that there was a strong association between the degree that their psychological needs were thwarted and their rise in depressive symptoms. Ultimately, this thesis would be my first publication and the link to it is found <a href="Publication 1.pdf">here</a>.</p>
											<p>Not long after I wrote my first scientific paper, I joined <a href="https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/harnad">Dr. Stevan Harnad</a>’s lab and wrote a cognitive science <a href="Contofalsky_Robert_Writing-Sample.pdf">paper</a> about a pilot project to examine how/if humans can learn auditory categories through supervised learning. Excitingly enough, our preliminary results were statistically significant and we demonstrated that our categories are learnable from our sample of 35 participants.</p>
									<p>In my senior year, I worked on a very technical neurochemical project with <a href="https://aleksandrinaskv.github.io/">Dr. Aleksandrina Skvortsova</a> while under the supervision of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/jeffrey-mogil">Dr. Jeffrey Mogil.</a> Throughout the academic year, we investigated the nocebo hyperalgesia effect and its underlying neurochemistry. The results of the study will remain confidential until publication. We are aiming to be published in the “Canadian Journal of Pain” in Q2 of 2023.</p> 
									<h3 class="major">Selected Essays</h3>
									<p>When it comes to my personal writing samples that I would like to share two very specific pieces of writing: my final undergraduate paper, and a persoanl manuscript.</p> 
									<p>For my last undergrad <a href="Contofalsky_R_HIST509_FINAL.pdf">paper</a>, it is a very different topic compared to my psychology based research papers, as it was written for my history minor. To keep things brief (as this essay is very complicated), this was my final essay for the seminar class <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2022-2023/courses/hist-509">"European Intellectual History”</a>, where I investigated how medieval translators carried and maintained significant medieval history, culture, politics, science, and medical knowledge. For my topic, I chose to write about the Slavic disciples, Cyril and Methodius, and the linguistic, theological, and political journey they embarked on when creating a writing system for the Slavs.</p>
									<p>The manuscript that I am currently writing about is my personal thesis/theory as to how cognitive science can, and should, be synthesized with education/pedagogy. In this book, I try to make the argument that the intellectual demands that civilization place on human beings necessitates an educational system that can keep up with those demands. In other words, the future should transform the K-12 curriculum from a “fit-to-work” model to a “fit-for-autonomy” model, and not only is this necessary, but that is possible as a result of how our brains categorize information. The framework that my book is written in is through the theory of categorization and conceptualization. I argue that the future generation of K-12 curiculums will be based in the theory of categorization/conceptualization, as those theories can help us inform what ideas, concepts, and categories children and adolescents are able to handle at specific ages.</p>
